FEHD is written in c++/cuda which is not exclusive to any particular
OS. However, I very much am. I do not know how to compile the code in
windows, nor do any windows users I have asked. The easiest way to use
cuda (and FEHD) in windows is to install ubuntu as a virtual
machine. Fortunately, Microsoft has streamlined the process so that it
doesn't require any specialized knowledge, and it integrates into
windows seamlessly. It is called WSL2 (windows subsystem linux). It is
provided by microsoft.

First, FEHD and cuda utilize nvidia gpus. If you have one, check that
the driver is installed. It should be. If it's not, install it (from
nvidia website).

Now, install the WSL ubuntu VM. Open a 'powershell' as an
administrator. At the prompt:

> wsl --install

When it is done, restart the (physical) machine. When you log back in
a terminal window will open asking to choose a username and a
password. You'll need these credentials to do administrative
things. Once you've done this you should be sitting at a prompt in an
ubuntu terminal window. First thing is to update all of the packages
to the most recent version.

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

Answer yes when asked whether you want to follow through with the
installs.

We need some non-cuda libraries, in particular BLAS, LAPACK and an
LAPACK extension for c++ called LAPACKE. If you request to install
LAPACKE, everything else we need are dependencies and will be
installed as well. 

$ sudo apt-get install g++
$ sudo apt-get install liblapacke-dev

I would restart the machine again here, though I don't know if you
need to.

Now install the cuda libraries. The links below might be stale, so I
would go to the cuda download pages and select the ubuntu-WSL version
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit - it is imperative that you
choose the WSL version. The WSL version installs the cuda toolkit, but
not the driver. The system driver that you verified above, in the
first step, is used. Installing a driver in the VM won't work. 

$ wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin
$ sudo mv cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
$ wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/12.4.0/local_installers/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-4-local_12.4.0-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-4-local_12.4.0-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo cp /var/cuda-repo-wsl-ubuntu-12-4-local/cuda-*-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-12-4

If there are no errors then cuda is installed, however not in the
path.

$ export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}

Next, compile FEHD.

$ git clone https://github.com/jddrvr/FEHD_cuda.git
$ cd FEHD_cuda
$ make
$ sudo mv FEHD /usr/local/bin/

Now, use FEHD.

$ cd examples
